# SVM and MLP Classification Task
Practice task for machine learning which implement Support Vector Machine and Multilayer Perception 



# Intro 
Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multilayer Perception (MLP) are both fundamental approaches to data classification. Both algorithms incorporate  kernel functions for improving accuracy in there classifications. The type of kernel functions, parameters, and processing vary and can be determined by the user of the program. The user of the program ultimately must evaluate the findings of each approach for better selection. 
 
This task uses a Heart failure clinical records dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+failure+clinical+records). The goal of this task is to learn binary classification models that distinguish the two classes (in this case mortality event or not).
