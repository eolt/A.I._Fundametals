# SVM and MLP Classification Task
Practice task for machine learning which implement Support Vector Machine and Multilayer Perception 



# Intro 
Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multilayer Perception (MLP) are both fundamentally used for data classification. Both algorithms use a kernel functions for improving accuracy in there classifications. The type of kernel functions vary and can be determined by the user of the program.
